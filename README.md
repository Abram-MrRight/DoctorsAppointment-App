# Doctors Appointment Mobile App
A doctor's appointment app developed with Flutter is a mobile application designed to streamline the process of scheduling and managing medical appointments.

Having a mobile Doctorâ€™s Appointment system is one step to making both patients and their doctors satisfied with medical services. For patients, the app would make it easier to find a doctor, book an appointment, and manage their medical records. For doctors, the app would help to reduce paperwork, improve efficiency, and provide better patient care.
